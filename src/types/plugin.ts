    /**
     * These settings allow specifying tag prefixes used by Xray when exporting or importing feature
     * files and Cucumber test results. The plugin will access these options to verify that your
     * feature files are tagged correctly according to your Xray prefix scheme.
     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * Whenever Cucumber test results or entire feature files are imported, Xray tries to link
     * existing test and precondition Jira issues with the executed/present Cucumber scenarios and
     * backgrounds. The default matching is quite involved (see documentation for
     * {@link https://docs.getxray.app/display/XRAY/Importing+Cucumber+Tests+-+REST | Xray server}
     * or {@link https://docs.getxray.app/display/XRAYCLOUD/Importing+Cucumber+Tests+-+REST | Xray cloud}),
     * but luckily Xray also supports and uses
     * {@link https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/?lang=java#tags | feature file tags}.
     *
     * The tags are of the form `@CYP-123` or `@Prefix:CYP-123`, containing an optional prefix and
     * the issue key. The concrete prefix and whether a prefix is at all necessary depends on your
     * configured prefix scheme in Xray.
     *
     * If any tag in a feature file (and thus the Cucumber JSON report used for importing test
     * execution results) is not consistent with the scheme defined in Xray, Xray will reject the
     * imported results altogether.
     *
